Competition

Conflict:
Multiple viable trades are proffered to an actor from other actors, or for multiple resources.

Solution:
A trade occurs between two actors

----

Sharing

Conflict:
Owner does not want to transfer the entirety of their resource

Solution:
Partial transfer occurs

----

Providing

Conflict:
Owner has no wants, freely offers resource without expectation of mutuality

Solution:
Resource is transferred

----

Chain

Conflict:
Actor A has a resource.
Actor B wants a resource.
Actors A and B cannot directly engage in transfer.

Solution:
Actor(s) C (D, E, etc) act as intermediaries to facilitate the overall transfer process from A to B


----

Candling

Conflict:
As with chain
Also, resource is clonable

Solution: as with chain. Any intermediary actors can retain posession of the resource.

----
Pass-the-parcel

Conflict:
As with chain
Also, resource is not clonable

Solution: as with chain. No intermediary actors retain posession of the resource.

----
Unwilling recipient

Conflict:
As with transfer.
Also, receiver does not give permission (explicitly, or implicitly)

---

Unwitting recipient

Conflict:
As with transfer.
Also, receiver is unaware of receipt. As such, they may neither explicitly or implicitly give permission.
