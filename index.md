### Trading Patterns

This is David Creigh, Tom Wallis, and Tony Crowther's submission for the Glasgow CREATe hackathon in May 2016. 

The project attempts to solve the question: *"do legal alternatives reduce piracy"*? We believe that the answer can be found by employing design patterns to characterise interactions between legal entities in a robust, yet easy to understand way that can aid understanding and allow quick and cohesive models of legal interaction. 

When entities interact -- particularly with copyright law -- they often transfer and trade resources between each other, whether that be music files, books, or money. Different interactions between different groups of people are motivated by different problems, and provide different solutions. To represent this, we use Design Patterns, perfectly suited to providing situations where an issue might require a solution, and an appropriate and proven solution to the problem. We can use this to develop a rudimentary Pattern Language, which connects these patterns together into a cohesive whole. 

This site provides an overview of the work already done, its current utility, and speculates on where this development should be taken next.
