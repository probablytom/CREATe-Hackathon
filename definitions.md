### Pattern Language Components

The entries on this page describe the basic parts that comprise the pattern language.

---

* **Actor:** an entity (either individual (such as a person) or aggregate (such as a business)) that is able to perform some *actions*.
* **Action:** the expression/exhibition of a number of behaviours (typically but not necessarily non-zero) enacted that result in an entity either modifying itself or its *environment*.
* **Environment:** unspecified or unknown components of the system under examination. In other words, non-specific *actors*, *resources*, or other entities.
* **Resource:** a quantifiable, potentially transferable entity (e.g. money, food, services, intellectual property)
* **Consumption:** the process of withdrawing a resource from general circulation between entities in its current form, e.g. investment, decay or eating. (i.e. the entity is no longer extant, the intrisic integrity has been compromised. Potential for meaningful exchange has been extinguished.)
* **Have:** the state of being where an actor IS in posession of a specific *resource*.
* **Want:** the state of being where an actor is NOT in posession of a specific *resource* (typically one they desire).
* **Channel:** the medium via which a *transfer* can occur
* **Pattern:** some structure describing a recurring problem and a general solution to that problem which should fit many situations.
