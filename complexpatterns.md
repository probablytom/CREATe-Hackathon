## Complex design patterns

Here we list a series of more complex design patterns, based on the patterns listed [on the patterns page](http://tomwallis.net/CREATe-Hackathon/patterns).


### Competition

**Conflict:**

* Multiple viable trades are proffered to an actor from other actors, or for multiple resources.

**Solution:**

* A trade occurs between two actors, with one actor choosing who to deal with from a range of candidates.

----

### Coopetition

**Conflict:**

* As with competition

**Solution:**

* As with competition, but the trade directly benefits all candidates that can be chosen from, regardless of who is chosen.

----

### Sharing

**Conflict:**

* Owner does not want to transfer the entirety of their resource

**Solution:**

* Partial transfer occurs

----

### Providing

**Conflict:**

* Owner has no wants, freely offers resource without expectation of mutuality

**Solution:**

* Resource is transferred

----

### Chain

**Conflict:**

* Actor A has a resource.
* Actor B wants a resource.
* Actors A and B cannot directly engage in transfer.

**Solution:**

* Actor(s) C (D, E, etc) act as intermediaries to facilitate the overall transfer process from A to B


----

### Candling

**Conflict:**

* As with chain
* Also, resource is clonable

**Solution:** 

* As with chain. Any intermediary actors can retain posession of the resource.

----

### Pass-the-parcel

**Conflict:**

* As with chain
* Also, resource is not clonable

**Solution:**

* As with chain. No intermediary actors retain posession of the resource.

----

### Unwilling recipient

**Conflict:**

* As with transfer.
* Also, receiver does not give permission (explicitly, or implicitly)

---

### Unwitting recipient

**Conflict:**

* As with transfer.
* Also, receiver is unaware of receipt. As such, they may neither explicitly or implicitly give permission.
